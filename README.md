# Theoretical-Physics-Notes

These are my notes for some of BCs degree physics courses taught at the University of Turin.

These notes are compiled based on material delivered in lectures as well as the lecture notes provided, various textbooks, and other sources.

These notes are correct to the best of my knowledge but since they are my personal notes they are likely to contain errors, typos, and mistakes. Please inform me if you find any sort of mistake or if you simply think that there is an improvement that could be made. The notes assume knowledge of the courses from previous years and possibly of other courses run at the same time. That said the notes should be fairly standalone for anyone with an equivalent amount of maths and/or physics education as I had at the time that I took the course.
